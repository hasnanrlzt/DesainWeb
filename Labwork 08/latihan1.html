    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>

    <p>The <span class="stabillo">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>
        ,<span>Sebelas Maret University</span>,
        Surakarta is an 
        <span class="stabillo">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors.
        Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
        <span class="stabillo">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The <span class="stabillo"> Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) </span> 
        study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the 
        <span class="stabillo"> Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> 
        department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. 
        PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are 
        <span class="stabillo"> prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs </span>. 
        So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as 
        <span class="stabillo"> Building Engineering Education </span>, and
        <span class="stabillo"> Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. 
        To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct 
        <span class="stabillo"> resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
